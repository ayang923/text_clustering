Upon his death, he was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen".

He presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the U.S. Constitution and a federal government.He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the United States", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism.Washington owned slaves, and in order to preserve national unity he supported measures passed by Congress to protect slavery.He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president.[5] Washington's great-grandfather John Washington immigrated in 1656 from Sulgrave, England, to the British Colony of Virginia where he accumulated 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of land, including Little Hunting Creek on the Potomac River.George Washington was born February 22, 1732, at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia,[6] and was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington.[7] By English common law Washington was a naturalized subject of the King, as were all others born in the English colonies.[8] His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had three additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler.When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.He was a talented draftsman and map-maker.By early adulthood he was writing with "considerable force" and "precision",[11] however his writing displayed little wit or humor.[13] He received a surveyor's license the following year from the College of William & Mary;[c] Fairfax appointed him surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia, and he thus familiarized himself with the frontier region, resigning from the job in 1750.By 1752 he had bought almost 1,500 acres (600 ha) in the Valley and owned 2,315 acres (937 ha).[18]On January 6, 1759, Washington, at age 26, married Martha Dandridge Custis, the 28-year-old widow of wealthy plantation owner Daniel Parke Custis.The marriage took place at Martha's estate; she was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and the couple created a happy marriage.[49] They raised John Parke Custis (Jacky) and Martha Parke (Patsy) Custis, children from her previous marriage, and later their grandchildren Eleanor Parke Custis (Nelly) and George Washington Parke Custis (Washy).[52]The marriage gave Washington control over Martha's one-third dower interest in the 18,000-acre (7,300 ha) Custis estate, and he managed the remaining two-thirds for Martha's children; the estate also included 84 slaves.[54] In late 1770, Washington inspected the lands in the Ohio and Great Kanawha regions, and he engaged surveyor William Crawford to subdivide it.Crawford allotted 23,200 acres (9,400 ha) to Washington; Washington told the veterans that their land was hilly and unsuitable for farming, and he agreed to purchase 20,147 acres (8,153 ha), leaving some feeling they had been duped.[59] His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him £1,800 in debt by 1764, prompting him to diversify.[60] In 1765, because of erosion and other soil problems, he changed Mount Vernon's primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat and expanded operations to include corn flour milling and fishing.[61] Washington also took time for leisure with fox hunting, fishing, dances, theater, cards, backgammon, and billiards.

Previously, he led Patriot forces to victory in the nation's War for Independence.Washington has been called the "Father of His Country" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the new nation.Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War.[15]In 1751 Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados, hoping the climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis.[17] Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761.Washington's 1751 bout with smallpox is thought to have rendered him sterile, though it is equally likely "Martha may have sustained injury during the birth of Patsy, her final child, making additional births impossible.[57] He won election with roughly 40 percent of the vote, defeating three other candidates with the help of several local supporters.[62]Washington soon was counted among the political and social elite in Virginia.From 1768 to 1775, he invited some 2,000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate, mostly those whom he considered "people of rank".[63]Washington's step-daughter Patsy Custis suffered from epileptic attacks from age 12, and she died in his arms in 1773.

The Washington family was a wealthy Virginia family which had made its fortune in land speculation.

[10]Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but he did learn mathematics, trigonometry, and land surveying.He became one of Virginia's wealthiest men, which increased his social standing.He rarely spoke in his early legislative career, but he became a prominent critic of Britain's taxation and mercantilist policies in the 1760s.

[16] Washington contracted smallpox during that trip, which immunized him but left his face slightly scarred.[56] He plied the voters with beer, brandy, and other beverages, although he was absent while serving on the Forbes Expedition.The following day, he wrote to Burwell Bassett: "It is easier to conceive, than to describe, the distress of this Family".

He later became troubled with the institution of slavery and freed his slaves in a 1799 will.[9] The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735, then to Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1738.In pursuit of admiration, status, and power, he tended to attribute his shortcomings and failures to someone else's ineffectuality.

He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris in 1783.Washington played a key role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution and was then elected president (twice) by the Electoral College.During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty.He has been memorialized by monuments, art, geographical locations, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank him among the greatest U.S. presidents.[12]Washington often visited Mount Vernon and Belvoir, the plantation that belonged to Lawrence's father-in-law William Fairfax.[55] He also doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6,500 acres (2,600 ha) and increased its slave population to more than a hundred by 1775.

George Washington (February 22, 1732[b] – December 14, 1799) was an American political leader, military general, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army.He commanded American forces, allied with France, in the defeat and surrender of the British during the Siege of Yorktown.He endeavored to assimilate Native Americans into Anglo-American culture but combated indigenous resistance during occasions of violent conflict.Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father, and Washington spent a month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfax's Shenandoah Valley property."[50] They lamented the fact that they had no children together.[51] They moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he took up life as a planter of tobacco and wheat and emerged as a political figure.[53]At Washington's urging, Governor Lord Botetourt fulfilled Dinwiddie's 1754 promise of land bounties to all volunteer militia during the French and Indian War.[56]As a respected military hero and large landowner, Washington held local offices and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758.[58]A mezzotint of Martha Washington, standing, wearing a formal gown, based on a 1757 portrait by John WollastonMartha Washingtonbased on a 1757 portrait by John WollastonBy occupation Washington was a planter, and he imported luxuries and other goods from England, paying for them by exporting tobacco.He became more politically active in 1769, presenting legislation in the Virginia Assembly to establish an embargo on goods from Great Britain.[64] He canceled all business activity and remained with Martha every night for three months.
